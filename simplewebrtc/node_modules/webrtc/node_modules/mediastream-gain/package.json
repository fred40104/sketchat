This module is a small part of [SimpleWebRTC](http://simplewebrtc.com) where it is used for minimizing echos, by using [hark](http://latentflip.com/hark) to determine if you're speaking and turning your mic down a bit if you're not.\n\nThis module is suitable for use with [browserify](http://browserify.org)/CommonJS on the client. \n\nIf you're not using browserify or you want AMD support use `mediastream-volume.bundle.js`.\n\n\n## Important details\n\n1. **NOTE:** as of this writing FireFox (while it has good WebAudio support in upcoming versions doesn't have support for using media from getUserMedia as an audio source even in its most cutting edge releases. Specifically there's no `AudioContext.prototype.createMediaStreamSource`. So this can't be use to mute an audio stream, for example.\n\n2. The way this works by replacing the first audio channel in the stream with one that is run through a gain filter. But beware that this *edits the stream you give it in place* it doesn't produce a new one.\n\n\n## Installing\n\n```\nnpm install mediastream-gain\n```\n\n## An example\n\nHere we use another piece of SimpleWebRTC [getusermedia](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/getusermedia) to fetch user media in a cross-browser, easy-to-handle-errors-and-lack-of-support sort of way. \n\nThis assumes a commonJS environment, but that's not a requirement (see above).\n\n```js\nvar MicGainController = require('mediastream-gain');\nvar getUserMedia = require('getusermedia');\nvar gainController;\n\ngetUserMedia(function (err, stream) {\n    // this will replace the audio channels in the \n    // stream\n    gainController = new MicGainController(stream);\n    // set gain to 20%\n    gainControl.setGain(.2);\n    // set gain to 0, effectively muting it\n    gainControl.getGain(0); \n    // there's also:\n    gainControl.off(); // equivalent to setGain(0)\n    gainControl.on(); // equivalent to setGain(1)\n});\n\n```\n\n## Methods\n\nIt couldn't be simpler, but behavior varies slighly based on availability of WebAudio support that can be wired into WebRTC. Firefox, has WebAudio but user media can't yet be used as a source, rendering it useless for WebRTC applications.\n\nYou can check for support by checking the `support` property of the an instance of `gainController`\n\nThese will simply be noop functions if WebAudio isn't fully supported. \n\n**.setGain(Float)** - takes a number between 1 and 0\n**.getGain()** - returns current setting\n**.off()** - shortcut for turning mic off \n**.on()** - shortcut for full gain\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Created By\n\nIf you like this, follow: [@HenrikJoreteg](http://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg) on twitter.\n\n",
